 * Mithril expects a globally available `requestAnimationFrame` in

 * emulate the ascynchronous nature of the function, but we don't
 * need to test for asynchronous DOM vagaries, so we make it instant
 * for much simpler testing.
 *
 * This means standard m.redraw() calls and procedural triggers
 * (bound event handler execution) will cause synchronous redraws:
 * complex tests can be written without worrying about race conditions.
